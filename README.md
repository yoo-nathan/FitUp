# User Manuals 
### Getting Started 
After downloading the FitUp app, begin by signing up with your Emory email account. Enter your email, create a password, and consent to data collection. You’ll then receive a verification code via email; once verified, you can complete your registration.

Next, fill out your profile with detailed information including your name, gender, age, height, weight, personal records, workout goals, schedule, and preferred styles. The more specific you are, the better your chances of finding an ideal gym partner.

### After Registration
Upon signing in, you'll be directed to the homepage where you can see a list of potential gym partners, ranked by compatibility. Click on a user’s profile to view their specific details like height, weight, and workout schedule. If you're interested in connecting, simply hit the chat button to start a conversation and potentially arrange a workout.

For more tailored results, use the filter button on the homepage. This feature lets you specify preferences for gender, personal records, workout schedules, and goals. Adjusting these filters will refresh your homepage with a list more aligned with your preferences. You can also choose to hide your profile from other users by deactivating the active button in the top right of the homepage.

### Navigation Buttons
The app includes four main navigation buttons:
Home: Returns you to the homepage to browse potential partners.
Chat: Open your previous conversations.
Menu: Displays your targeted nutritional goals (calories, carbohydrates, proteins, fats) based on your profile data. Follow the suggested DCT menu recommendations to meet these goals. Note: Cox menu recommendations will be available once Emory provides specific nutritional details.
Profile: Allows you to edit your settings, contact FitUp support, logout, or delete your account.

### Diet Recommendation Explained
Specifically for the menu page, you can get your targeted calories, carbohydrates, protein, and fat which is calculated based on your age, height, weight, gender, and your workout purpose. You can follow that targeted nutrition to achieve your workout goal. Below that, you also have a detailed DCT menu recommendation, which is made based on your targeted nutrition. When you follow the diet plan provided, you will achieve your targeted nutrition. The recommendations are based on the DCT menus updated everyday, and you can click each modal for the specific nutrition information about each specific menu. The Cox menu recommendations are not provided yet since Emory does not provide specific nutrition information about Cox menus in the website, but it will soon be updated. 

# Common Troubleshooting Guides

### Token Expired
When you log in to the app and leave it for a long time and come back, the buttons might not function well because the token may expire. You can simply log out and login again and the problem will be resolved. 

### Menu Page loading
The menu page takes time to load the data for your targeted calories and the DCT menu recommendation, since the app is feeding your targeted nutrition information to openai api to get the recommendation based on it. It will take more than 20 seconds, so when you just wait, the page will be loaded.
